# Pricing prediction

## Goal: 
Goal: Develop a machine learning model with high accuracy and low execution time for used cars market value determination.

## Description:
Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Gradient Boosting with LightGBM models wede developed and tested. Ridge Regression model takes the least amount of time for model training. Its RMSE = 2612.68 which is quite good for fast predictions. LightGBM with CV shows the best quality of predictions (RMSE = 1546.85), although it takes longer to train the model.

## Libraries used:
* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn
* math
* plotly
* matplotlib
