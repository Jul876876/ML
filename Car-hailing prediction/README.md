# Car-hailing prediction

## Goal: 
Predict the number of car-hailing requests for the next hour in order to bring more drivers for the peak load periods. Use historical car-hailing activity data to make the prediction model with RMSE less than 48 on the test set.

## Description:
Lightgbm model with standard heperparameters shows the best RMSE metric (43.77) on the test set was developed. Quality of the model corresponds to the set goal.

## Libraries used:
* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn
* lightgbm 
* statsmodels
