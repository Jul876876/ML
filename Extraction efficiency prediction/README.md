# Gold extraction efficiency prediction

## Goal: 
Develop machine learning algorithm for gold extraction efficiency prediction using the extraction and processing parameters data.

## Description:
Metal concentration depending on different processing stage is analyzed. Average concentration of gold increases after each subsequent processing stage and concentration of silver decreases. Average concentration of lead increases after floatation and remains about the same after further stages. Gold extraction from gold ore coefficient prediction model is chosen and trained with sMAPE = 7.74 on validation data. Test set predictions are made.

## Libraries used:
* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn
* matplotlib
* statsmodels
