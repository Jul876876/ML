# Customer Attrition Prediction

## Goal: 
Develop a machine learning algorithm with f1-score not less than 0.59 for customer attrition prediction analysis.

## Description:
Logistic regression was tested for balanced and imbalanced datasets. Class weights addition shows the best results in class imbalance control compared to other methods applied. Hyper-parameters selection for Random Forest Classifier shows F1 = 0.63 and auc_roc = 0.86 for test set.

## Libraries used:
* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn
* matplotlib
