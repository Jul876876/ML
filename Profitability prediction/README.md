# Profitability prediction for oil field wells development

## Goal: 
Develop a machine learning algorithm for oil field wells profitability analysis. Assess poterntial profit and risks. The model will be used for region selection for further development.

## Description:
There are three candidates for development. Each of them have 10 000 oil field wells. Data of oil quality and amount of row material is available for each well. Three regions with oil fields were analyzed for profitability of future development. Region 1 showed the highest predicted profit (518 mil. rubles) and the lower risk percentage (less that 1%). Model RMSE for this region is also the lowest compared to the other two regions. Based on this study, Region_1 is recommended for further oil field wells development.
